# Distances-By-Stats
This project will test to which extent we can mesure distance between two points by selecting a number of random parameters

## Objectives
- [ ] Code a method to calculate the distance between two N-dimensionnal vectors
- [ ] Add random selection of n coordinates of the two vectors
- [ ] Compare this calculus by a selection to the real distance
- [ ] Make stats/graphs and try to draw conclusions
